The following is to be entered in the termial of Ubuntu 14.04

cd ns-allinone-3.19/

cd ns-3.19/

./waf  --run  file_name ( the name given in the scratch folder ,without the .cc extension)


To view the .pcap files enter the ns-3.19 folder and double click it (provided you have Wire Shark installed in Ubuntu 14.04).
